# Rugby2019Predictor
We try and predict the best shares to buy in an office competition based on the rugby 2019 world cup.

FUNDAMENTALS

·   Entrants ‘buy shares’ in teams. Every time a team wins a match, it gets a certain number of points. The points are distributed amongst the shareholders, proportionate to the number of shares they have bought.

Each entrant may buy 16 shares. You can take at most only 4 shares in any one team. There are no other restrictions.
The number of shares per team is not fixed; the better teams will earn more points, but those points are likely to be spread among more shares. Shares cannot be ‘traded’ once the deadline has passed.
 

POINTS ALLOCATION

·   The number of points a team gets by winning a match depends on the stage of the tournament:

·   Pool stage draw: 15 points

·   Pool stage win: 30 points

·   Pool runner-up: 15 points

·   Pool winner: 30 points

·   Q-final win: 40 points

·   3rd place play-off win: 40 points

·   S-final win: 80 points

·   World Cup winner: 120 points

·   The number of points you get: (Points awarded to a team) x (Number of shares you own in the team) / (Total number of shares in the team)

·   The winner is the player who has the most points after the tournament. In case of a tie, the player who owns a bigger share in the winning team wins (or if those are equal then the runner-up and so on). As organiser, I will be entering but will not be eligible to win.

 

EXAMPLE

Scenario: England win everything: all 4 pool stage matches, their pool, QF, SF and WC, thereby accruing the maximum 390 points total. England were a popular pick and 50 shares were sold. You own 4 of those shares. You get 390*4/50 = 31.2 added to your score.
Scenario: Fiji beat Georgia and Uruguay, do not progress further, but accrue 60 points total. Fiji were not a popular pick and only 6 shares were sold. You own 3 of those shares. You get 60*3/6 = 30 added to your score.
